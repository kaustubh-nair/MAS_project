# Multi-agent Systems Mini Project

In this project, the agents(turtles) perform three different tasks, where none of them are given imperative orders.
1. They form two different lines, one horizontal one vertical
2. Turtles of the same color form one line each of the same orientation.
3. The turtles form a compact block such that each turtle has at least three other turtles of the same colour as them, in their immediate neighbourhood.
